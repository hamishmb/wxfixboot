I respect your privacy.

Hence, WxFixBoot collects only information it requires to run, or is of significant importance to the user, and it won't report any information it collects at all, to anybody.

It has never done, and it never will.

In order to run, WxFixBoot needs to gain detailed information about devices (Device names, types ("Partition" or "Device"), Host Disks (e.g. /dev/sda is the host of /dev/sda2), Any partitions the device contains, Vendor, Product, Capacity, Description, Flags, Partitioning, Filesystem, UUID, ID, and the Boot Record), and for debugging reasons this information is temporarily saved in a log file (/tmp/WxFixBoot.log). It does NOT include any personal, or personally identifiable information such as serial numbers or IP addresses.








Additionally, WxFixBoot collects the Vendor names, Product names, Capacity and Description (if available), of devices on your system. For LVM/RAID disks, WxFixBoot also collects the volume group name, and the logical volume name. This information is not required for WxFixBoot to run (with the exception of Size information for supporting the Reverse and Preallocate options on OS X), but instead collected to help you identify the disks you wish to recover data to and from, which helps avoid accidental data loss. All of this information can be viewed in the Disk Information Window, accessible from the Main Window (both as a button and in the view menu).

Finally, WxFixBoot spits the version of itself and that of python and wxpython into the log file on startup to aid debugging if the log file is later needed to resolve a problem, for example in a support request from a user.

When WxFixBoot is closed, all of this information (including the logfile itself) is completely deleted, unless you decide to save it somewhere else when prompted.
