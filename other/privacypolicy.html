        <title>WxFixBoot 3.0.0's Privacy Policy</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        I respect your privacy.
        <br>
        <p>
        Hence, WxFixBoot collects only information it requires to run, or is of significant importance to the user, and it won't report any information it collects at all, to anybody. WxFixBoot does also not collect any personal, or personally identifiable information.
        </p>
        <p><u>It has never done, and it never will.</u></p>

        <h2><center>Disk Information</center></h2>

        <p>
        In order to run, WxFixBoot needs to gain detailed information about disks. The information collected for this purpose is as follows:
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Disk name (e.g. /dev/sda, /dev/cdrom).</li>
            <li>Type (A partition, or a device).</li>
            <li>Host Disk (e.g. /dev/sda is the host of /dev/sda2).</li>
            <li>Any partitions the device contains, if any (opposite to Host Disk).</li>
            <li>The Disk's Filesystem, if any (e.g. ext4, ntfs, hfs+).</li>
            <li>Any flags the disk holds, which are used to get the Disk's partitioning.</li>
            <li>The Disks's partitioning, if any (GPT or MBR).</li>
            <li>UUID (Universally Unique Identifier), if any. These identify different disks on your system, and are generated randomly (either pseudo-randomly, or “actually” randomly).</li>
            <li>ID. As above.</li>
            <li>Boot Record, if any. This is used to double-check that a bootloader is present where WxFixBoot thinks it might be present.</li>
            <li>LVM/RAID disks: Volume group name, and the logical volume name, used to identify the disks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Some further Disk information is collected simply to make it easier for the user to identify their own disks. This information is as follows.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>The Disk's Vendor (if any).</li>
            <li>The Disk's Product (if any).</li>
            <li>The Disk's Capacity (if any).</li>
            <li>The Disk's Description (if any).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><center>Operating System Information</center></h2>

        <p>
        A smaller amount of information needs to be collected on each Linux Operating System installed on your machine as well. This is as follows:
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Operating System name (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04 xenial). This is used to identify each OS to the user and the WxFixBoot itself.</li>
            <li>Whether this Operating System is currently running. This is used to determine how to modify this OS’s bootloader, if the user asks to do so.</li>
            <li>Operating System Architecture (e.g. i386, or x86_64). This is used to determine if this OS’s bootloader can be modified later.</li>
            <li>The partition the Operating System resides on. This is needed to be able to modify the OS’s bootloader if asked to by the user.</li>
            <li>The Operating System’s package manager (either apt-get, or yum/dnf). As above.</li>
            <li>Information from each Operating System’s /etc/fstab file, allowing WxFixBoot to:</li>
            <li>Determine this OS’s EFI partition, if any (where EFI bootloaders reside and are installed to).</li>
            <li>Determine this OS’s Boot partition, if any (where the OS’s Linux kernel and initrd are stored, if not on /).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><center>Firmware Information</center></h2>

        <p>
        Your firmware type needs to be determined to check which bootloaders can be installed. For example, if you have EFI firmware, you (usually) need an EFI bootloader to start your Operating System, and installing a BIOS bootloader will not work, and vice versa. To collect this information, WxFixBoot will:
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Check to see if the EFI variables are present. If they are, then you have EFI firmware.</li>
            <li>If not, run “dmidecode -q -t BIOS” to get firmware information. If UEFI is mentioned in the output, you have UEFI firmware. If not, you have BIOS firmware.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><center>Bootloader Information</center></h2>

        <p>
        WxFixBoot also needs to gather information about the bootloaders on your system. This information is gathered for each OS, and is as follows:
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>The currently installed bootloader (e.g. ELILO, or GRUB2).</li>
            <li>Any bootloaders that are available for installation. This is used to present the user with a list of alternative bootloaders to install.</li>
            <li>The disk the bootloader is installed to. If we modify this bootloader, make sure it stays installed in the same place.</li>
            <li>Whether this bootloader can be modified.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Further information is gathered for your convenience, and allows the program to operate more smoothly, but is not absolutely necessary:
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>The bootloader’s timeout, if any. This allows WxFixBoot to keep it set the way it is when modifying the bootloader, and allows the user to change it as necessary.</li>
            <li>The bootloader’s global kernel options, if any. As above.</li>
            <li>The bootloader’s default OS, if any. As above.</li>
            <li>All of the bootloader's menu entries. This is used to set and get the bootloader's default OS and match them to the OSs WxFixBoot detected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><center>Other Information</center></h2>

        <p>
        A basic dependency check is done to ensure that WxFixBoot can function on this system. This is worth doing because crashing while halfway through an operation is not what any user would want.<br><br>

        A small amount of other information is collected in order for WxFixBoot to operate correctly:
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Whether the system is running on a live disk or not (this needs to be considered to gather OS info).</li>
            <li>If so, whether this live disk is Parted Magic (this silences a few errors that would otherwise stop the program).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Finally, WxFixBoot outputs the version of itself and that of python and wxpython into the log file on startup to aid debugging if the log file is later needed to resolve a problem, for example in a support request from a user.
        </p>

        <h2><center>Conclusion</center></h2>

        <p>
        The only collected information that cannot be viewed in the GUI is the firmware type, live disk, Parted Magic information, Lvm information, /etc/fstab contents, and boot record. This information is not visible because it would be confusing to the user, and is difficult to display. If you wish to see it, instead save the log file when you exit WxFixBoot.
        </p>

        <p>
        All the other information that is collected by WxFixBoot is accessible in the System Information Window. This window can be found in the View menu from the Main Window, or by clicking the “View More Details” button in the Bootloader Options Window.
        </p>

        <p>
        For debugging reasons, all of this information is temporarily saved in a log file (/tmp/wxfixboot.log). It does <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> include any personal, or personally identifiable information such as serial numbers or IP addresses.
        </p>

        <p>
        When WxFixBoot is closed, all of this information (including the logfile itself) is completely deleted, unless you decide to save it somewhere else when prompted.
